    <h1>Classic games,Anytime,Anywhere!!!</h1>

    <p>Due to its size and portability, the Nintendo Game Boy offers 
    an entertaining way to play video games from virtually anywhere.
    Easy enough for both adults and kids to operate, it features 
    a user-friendly interface. The large library of classic titles 
    available on the system, like Tetris and Pokémon, allows hours of
    gameplay. Because of the manner in which the system has been designed, 
    it is built to last and can be charged in a short period of time, which
    means many hours of fun await those who own one.</p>
